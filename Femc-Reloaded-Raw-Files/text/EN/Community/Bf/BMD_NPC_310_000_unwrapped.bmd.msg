[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]Oh, you must be the new girl. Let me give you some advice.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]Make sure you study hard for exams. There will be some tricky questions.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]If you only study at home, don't you ever feel like you're not studying enough?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]If you do, then I recommend making use of the library.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]You can use the books there and concentrate on studying in silence, and it's free![n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]Only time will tell...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]I'm not gonna worry about my score.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_003_0_0 [Studious Student]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]I'm neither happy nor disappointed with my score, since it's about average.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]How'd you do, new girl?[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]Did you hear about the two people who were found unconscious?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]I bet fewer people will be cheating on their significant others from now on.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]After all, one of them was a man and the other a woman.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]Those are pretty incriminating circumstances, if you ask me.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_005_0_0 [Studious Student]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]Finals are a lot harder than midterms, you know.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]That doesn't necessarily mean I'll study harder...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]But we'll see. Sometimes the extra effort pays off.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_006_0_0 [Studious Student]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]It seems like the average score went down this time... I guess that's good for me, though.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]But, honestly, I'm a little disappointed. I think I could've scored about twenty points higher.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]I'll have to study harder during vacation.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]The first semester is just a warmup. The game starts for real during the second semester.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]You better use the library or study a lot at home.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_008_0_0 [Studious Student]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]This time, I know I did pretty good. I can't wait for the results.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_009_0_0 [Studious Student]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]I was happy with my score. All that studying I did during summer vacation paid off.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_010_0_0 [Studious Student]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]This test is just another small mountain on my path...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]The true challenge is the college entrance exams... Everything else is just practice.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]I'm sure we'll both study more than we ever imagined we'd have to for them.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[msg MSG_011_0_0 [Studious Student]]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]That was a hard test. I'm not sure how I did.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]I guess I'll have to wait for the scores to be posted.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]Now I don't have to be depressed during the break.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]How about yâ€” Um... You look kinda pale...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]W-Well, it's not the end of the world. Plus, you have another chance...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 310]So, cheer up.[n][uf 1 1][e]

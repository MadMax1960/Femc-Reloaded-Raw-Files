[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]Yeah, that's right. There's a fortune teller in this club.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]Everyone calls her "Den Mother" or "Mama," but...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]I heard if she tells your fortune, there's no getting a second opinion. What she tells you will come true.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]Why don't you visit her?[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]You know that fortune teller? The one they call "Den Mother" or "Mama"?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]She's got a very weird presence... It's like she's in another world.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]I want her to tell my fortune, but I don't have the courage to talk to her...[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]I had Mama tell my fortune, but it's true what they say... Her fortunes aren't like the others.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]Everything that came out of her mouth was so abstract...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]She never said anything like, "Be careful of this," or "This will bring good fortune."[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]I don't really have any friends... But I'm trying to make some.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]So I asked Mama how I could meet more people.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]Her answer was still pretty abstract, but it helped me come up with a solution![n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 405]I'll try doing it next time...[n][uf 1 1][e]

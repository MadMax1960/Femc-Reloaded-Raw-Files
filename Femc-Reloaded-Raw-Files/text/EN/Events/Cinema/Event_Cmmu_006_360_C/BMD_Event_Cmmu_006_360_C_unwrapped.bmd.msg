[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]I looked online, and since this mall belongs to the Kirijo Group, it was actually named after them.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]I think the Kirijo Group is also the parent organization of our school.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]Interesting, huh?[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]I was talking to the owner of Aohige Pharmacy about cooking...[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][uf 4 23 0 6 0 25 25]Um... If I did make a dish with dried snake meat, would you still eat it, [uf 4 1]-chan?[n][uf 1 1][e]

[sel SEL_003_0_0 top]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1]Sure I would.[e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1]You don't have to.[e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 4 65535 65535 0 0]But, if you really want me to, then...[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 6 65535 65535 0 0]...I'm sorry. I don't think I can do it. The thought of touching a snake, dead or alive, is terrifying.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 1 65535 65535 0 0]I was worried you'd say that you want to try it...[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]I mean, have you ever seen dried snake meat!?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]It has the texture of a Shadow, and it's the size of a hose on a fire truck...[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]There's no way I'm bringing something like that back to the dorm with me! I can't even bear to touch it![n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 4 5 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]But the texture might still feel too similar to a snake. I don't know that I could bring myself to touch that either...[n][uf 1 1][e]

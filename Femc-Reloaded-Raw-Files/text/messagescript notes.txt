Notes on what the different "tags" (ie [uf ...], [n], [e] etc. etc.) do in the .msg files:

[uf 0 1 x] - Changing text color.
	Example: [uf 0 1 2]TEST-TEXT[uf 0 1 27]
		 [uf 0 1 2] = Red
		 [uf 0 1 27] = White

[uf 0 5 65278] - Unknown; most likely unused, same as almost every other persona game

[uf 1 1] - waits for user-input to continue to next message box (if AUTO is enabled, the game will wait until either a voice line finishes playing or just waiting a while)

[uf 3 1 x x x x x x] - determines voice line to play for message box

[uf 2 1] - Unknown; most likely toggles between instant text display and scrolling text

(probably never needed by us but still nice to know)
[uf 4 1] - last name of your character
[uf 4 2] - first name of your character

[uf 4 5 x x x x x x] - Sets bustup to display for message box

[uf 4 17 x x x] - Unknown; most likely determines cut-in texture to display

[n] - Forces all proceeding text to go on a new-line.
	The game appears to feature automatic text wrapping, so you don't actually need to use this that often

[e] - declares end of current message box

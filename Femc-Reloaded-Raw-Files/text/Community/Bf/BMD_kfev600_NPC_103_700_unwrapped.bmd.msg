[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 103]Looks like my takoyaki has completely captured your heart... or should I say, stomach?[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 103]...What's wrong? You're weirdly quiet today.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 103]You do look really pale... You should probably go home and get some rest.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 103]It'd be bad for business if you ate my takoyaki and then passed out.[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]Another victim of those mysterious incidents was found at Gekkoukan High.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]Since the victim was at the front gate, that must be the scene of the crime.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]If the victim was attacked somewhere else, they'd have to be carried to the front gate.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]But why would the culprit do such a thing? The reasoning doesn't add up.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]Anyway, there's a high probability that Gekkoukan itself is involved in all this somehow...[n][uf 1 1][e]

[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]No one heard so much as a scream.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]It's like nothing ever happened... Or at least no one will admit to knowing anything.[n][uf 1 1][e]
[uf 0 5 65278][uf 2 1][uf 5 21 1 402]They just brush it off as a "tragic case of juvenile crime"... But I think this goes deeper.[n][uf 1 1][e]
